I am a 5th year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/). I am student organizer of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab Doctoral Seminars](https://fintech.stanford.edu/events/doctoral-seminars). 

I'm broadly interested in intersection of econometrical tools and real-life applications, including learning-informed market design problems and statistical formulation of the academic replication crisis, particularly in empirical asset pricing.

You can reach me at jiacheng zou at stanford dot edu!
