I am a 5th year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/). [Kay Giesecke](https://giesecke.people.stanford.edu/) and [Peter W. Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/) are members of my dissertation reading committee. I am the student organizer of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab Doctoral Seminars](https://fintech.stanford.edu/events/doctoral-seminars). 

I am passionate about improving human decision making with interpretable and transparent machine learning, especially in high-stake domains. To this end, I am bulding econometrics tools and applying them to real-life problems. My current work focuses on:
 - learning-informed market design problems, including experiment design, causal inference and algorithm design for cadevar organ allocations;
 - statistical guardrail to address the [reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a), particularly in inference problems on high-dimensional panel data of empirical asset pricing.
