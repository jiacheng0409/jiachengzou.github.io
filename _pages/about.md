I am a second year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, advised by [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau). I am grateful to be funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am a student co-organizer of the [Research on Algorithms and Incentives in Networks (RAIN) seminar](https://rain.stanford.edu/). 

Previously, I studied Computer Science with minors in [Global Health & Health Policy](https://globalhealth.princeton.edu/) and [Statistics & Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/) at Princeton. I formerly interned at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Health, [Google](https://google.com/), and [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

I'm interested in developing new methods inspired by computer science and operations research to improve the quality of patient care, both at the population health level and at the clinical level.
