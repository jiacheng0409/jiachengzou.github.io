__Bio__    

I am a final year PhD student in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, with PhD Minor in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/) on econometrics, to work with [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/) on mechanism design, and to have [Kay Giesecke](https://giesecke.people.stanford.edu/) and [Peter W. Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/) as committee members. I am affiliated with [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/), and I organize the lab's [Doctoral Seminar](https://fintech.stanford.edu/events/doctoral-seminars). <br>

__I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.__

__Why research?__    

I am passionate about improving _data-driven decision making_. I design methods for interpretable machine learning, design experiments and apply causal inference. My current work focuses on:
 - learning-informed market design problems in improving healthcare. This includes a retro experiment to test how AI can help reduce [non-utilized donated kidneys](https://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/2019/08/reducing-discards-of-deceased-donor.html);
 - statistical guardrail for the [reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a), particularly in inference problems on high-dimensional panel data. I apply the methods in empirical asset pricing, and network analysis.
