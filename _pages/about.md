__Bio__    

I am a 5th year PhD student in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, with PhD Minor in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/) on econometrics, to work with [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/) on mechanism design, and to have [Kay Giesecke](https://giesecke.people.stanford.edu/) and [Peter W. Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/) as committee members. I am the student organizer of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab Doctoral Seminars](https://fintech.stanford.edu/events/doctoral-seminars).

__Why research?__    

I am passionate about improving human decision making with interpretable and transparent machine learning, especially in high-stake domains. To this end, I am building econometrics tools and applying them to real-life problems. My current work focuses on:
 - learning-informed market design problems, including experiment design, causal inference and algorithm design for better cadevaric organ allocations to curtail [wastes](https://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/2019/08/reducing-discards-of-deceased-donor.html);
 - statistical guardrail for the [reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a), particularly in inference problems on high-dimensional panel data of empirical asset pricing.

You can reach me at jiacheng zou at stanford dot edu. My office is on 2nd floor of [Huang Engineering](https://engineering.stanford.edu/location).
