__Bio__    

I am a final year PhD student in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, with PhD Minor in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/). 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/). As a member of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/), I organize the lab's [Doctoral Seminar](https://fintech.stanford.edu/events/doctoral-seminars). 
Starting in late 2024, I will join [Columbia IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) as a postdoctoral research scientist hosted by [Agostino Capponi](https://www.columbia.edu/~ac3827/). <br>

My doctoral dissertation reading committee at Stanford: [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/), [Kay Giesecke](https://giesecke.people.stanford.edu/), [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/), [Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong), [Jann Spiess](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/jann-spiess/).

__Research brief__    

I develop statistical methods for inference in large dimensional data sets to make better decisions. My domain knowledge of financial economics problems informs my methodological work. 

I identify [a new class of multiple testing problems in panel data learning](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4315891), which is broadly applicable. In a sequence of follow-up papers, I use this framework for latent graphs learning and change point detection in time-series.
