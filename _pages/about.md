I am a 5th year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, advised by [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau). I am grateful to be funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). This year, I am a student co-organizer of the [Research on Algorithms and Incentives in Networks (RAIN) seminar](https://rain.stanford.edu/). 

I'm interested in developing new methods inspired by STATS and OR to improve the quality of patient care, both at the population health level and at the clinical level.

You can reach me at gzguan at stanford dot edu!
